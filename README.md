## Virtual Machine

Welcome to my VM project!

This repository is currently in its early stages. I’ll be pushing updates regularly as I build out a fully custom virtual machine from scratch.

This README will evolve into full documentation for the VM as it becomes more complete.

If you’re interested in the day-to-day progress — design decisions, debugging disasters, breakthroughs, and lessons learned — check out the **progression.md** file.  
I’ll be treating it like a build log / dev diary for this project.
